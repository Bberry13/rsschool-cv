## **ABOUT ME**
I started my career in the banking sector, in the opinion of my management, I had good success and I was going to be promoted, but for myself I understand that this area is not close to me. 

After that, I went into business and discovered a new field - logistics, namely the transportation of dangerous goods.

It was going uphill, excellent turnovers, independent study of the sphere and skills of selling a new product + organization of a funnel for the sales department, it was very interesting to me, there I first got acquainted with scripts in google tabs, according to video guides on youtube I made two tables, one consisted of a shipping request template, and the other part from the table in which employees enter data and after that it is converted into a completed application.
 
I really liked this area, we were aimed at the European market, but global circumstances were against me, so it was decided to sell the company, since all contractors stopped cooperating with our country. 

It was a strong blow to me and was temporarily decided to return to the banking sector, because everything is easy for me there and you can quickly restore your savings. 

Since childhood, I have been attracted to computers, but I only figured out the assembly of PCs and components, now I want to move to a new level for myself and open the gates to the world of IT!
